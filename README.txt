READ ME First!


To view the html website as intended, you will need to be online, as there are a couple of calls to online content delivery networks (CDN); these CDN host the required files that interact with the browser to display various elements and scripts properly.

To begin, simply open any of the .html files in your browser of choice. If you want to start from the home page of this website, open the index.html file first in your browser.
